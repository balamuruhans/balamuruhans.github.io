Welcome to my site! My blogs are intended to share ideas, technical details,
automated tests with Avocado-VT framework to functionally verify Linux
Virtualization features with Qemu and Libvirt.

I would like to explore, research, study, learn, collaborate, exchange ideas,
review comments for the betterment of the knowledge sharing with this blog.
